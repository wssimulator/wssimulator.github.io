                The WS-Simulator is used to experimentally analyze different variants of Work Stealing.
                Thus, it should handle the different variants of Work Stealing Algorithm.
                Moreover, the simulator needs to manage the different types of application,
                the different topologies and all other variants.

                </p>
                <p>
                WS-Simulator is designed to be sufficiently flexible in order to simulate different Work 
                Stealing models. Its flexibility aims to allow us to experiment with different
                Work Stealing algorithms, different topologies, different steal strategies
                and different types of application. The simulator should also generate a sufficient amount of 
                logs for a detailed analysis each tested scenario.

                The overall architecture of WS-Simulator is composed of six main engines, as seen on Figure.
                The <strong>event engine</strong> is the core of our simulator,
                it manages the processors events during the time to run the simulation of a scenario.
                The events are executed through the <strong>processor engine</strong> which provides different functionalities
                to perform the Work Stealing algorithm.
                The <strong>processor engine</strong> uses the <strong>task engine</strong> to manage the execution of tasks and uses the 
                <strong>topology engine</strong> to manage the interactions between the processors.
                During the execution of a simulation, the <strong>log engine</strong> keeps track ofdifferent information
                and generates different logs.

            <div class="w3-container">
                <p>
                In the Work Stealing algorithm, a processor switches between different possible states : 
                Each processor interacts when it becomes idle, when it receives a steal request 
                or when it receives a steal answer.
                The global idea of our simulator consists in simulating a set of discrete events through time
                instead of simulating the whole execution time, 
                where an event stands for changing the state of a processor at a specific time.
                For that:
                
                <h3 class="w3-text-black w3-padding-16">Event engine</h3>
                <p>
                The event engine represents the kernel of the simulator.
                it lists the available events on a heap and executes them sequentially according to their time.
                The execution of events follows different steps to update the system and creates new events
                in the global heap, these events will be executed following the same mechanism.
                We define an event by its time, its related processors and its type.
                
                The execution of an event interacts on the related processors and orders it to update
                its state and creates other events. The execution time is defined by the last executed event.

            <h3 class="w3-text-black w3-padding-16">Processor engine</h3>
                <p>
                The <strong>processor engine</strong> manages the processors state on the simulator,
                it offers all necessary functionalities to update aprocessor when a related event occurs.
                These functions apply the mechanism of Work Stealing algorithm.

                The <strong>processor engine</strong> uses <strong>topology engine</strong> to manage communications and interactions between the processors,
                The <strong>processor engine</strong> uses <strong>task engine</strong> to manage the execution of their tasks. 

   <h3 class="w3-text-black w3-padding-16">Topology engine</h3>
                <p>
                  A topology defines the distribution of the processors on the platform and the communication characteristics between them.
                  The <strong>topology engine</strong> is used for knowing the communication time between two processors during a steal operation.
                  Moreover, since the victim selection strategy depends on the processor topology, the <strong>topology engine</strong> is also used
                  to manage different victim selection strategies.
                  The <strong>topology engine<strong> is also used to manage different parameters which are used by the Work Stealing algorithm during
                  an execution, for example, <u>is_simultaneous</u> is used to determine if a processor can send work to several processors atthe same time.
                  It also defines <u>steal threshold</u> parameters which can be static or depend on the communication time.
            <h3 class="w3-text-black w3-padding-16">Task engine</h3>
                <p>
                  The <b>task engine</b> is used to handle everything related to the application duringa simulation.
                  It provides an operating interface which offers all the needed functionalities to manage tasks 
                  (create a new task during a simulation, split tasks during a steal request, generates the merge task if necessary, 
                  update the task dependencies, activate one or more tasks as in case of DAG task, ...)
                  
                  The <b>task engine</b> offers the mechanism to detect the end of an execution. It uses two global variables,
                  one to compute the number of created tasks in the system, and the second to compute the number of completed tasks.
                  The execution finishes when the created tasks are equal to the completed tasks.
                  
                  The <b>task engine</b> offers also different functions that automatically generate different application based on DAG tasks.
                  It also offers a function to use a predefined application as input. For this, the predefined application must be described in <b>JSON</b>
                  format.
